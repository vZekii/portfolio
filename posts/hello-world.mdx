# Hello, World!

I guess this is actually a *true* hello world, given that this will be on a live website, so **Hello World!**. Welcome to my first blog post. Can't say that I really read blogs or write much but hopefully you can decipher my poor writing quality and gain something out of these ramblings that I may or may not ever do. I do want to go on and talk about a bunch of things, but those should have their own posts, so I'll leave that for those.

## So what's in it for you
It's a good question. Honestly I can't say I know what I'll write about, but it'll most likely be technical write-ups of projects, events, and other interesting little things (maybe even some attempts at SaaS start-ups ðŸ‘€, *keyword* attempts)

## What's in it for me
Another good question. Honestly I don't really know why people write blogs, but I have to say that some of the technical write-ups on medium and personal blogs are really interesting - and have saved me a fair few times. So who knows, maybe you'll find a rope here to pull you out of a P1. 

In all honesty, I just want to write up some things, experiment with SEO, and maybe just maybe build some connections with some interesting people. *That's it*. 

## That's all folks
Thanks for stopping by, and who knows, this post might not even exist in the future.
